# Poddy - CLI Podcast Downloader

**NOTE! Poddy is still in BETA. Semantic versioning is not enforced and non-backwards compatible changes may be released at any time.** 

Poddy is a minimal-dependency command line tool for downloading podcast episodes from an RSS feed. To not miss out on any data, the generated shownotes (responsive HTML) also contain a viewable copy of the original XML. The shownotes are also made future-safe by downloading and embedding external images.

I originally made Poddy for my own use to help me archive my favorite podcasts. I'm hoping it might be useful for other data hoarders out there! ðŸ“¦ðŸ“š

Let me know if you encounter any issues and feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.

## Features

- Download episodes from a feed URL with flexible selections: earliest, latest, range, or all episodes
- Subscribe to feeds and continously download new episodes
- Download future-safe shownotes that are not susceptible to dead links. They are formatted as HTML but also contain the raw XML episode data for completeness.
- Search and find a feed URL by show name, from both iTunes and PodcastIndex.org (see [Search Engine Configuration](#search-engine-configuration))
- List episodes from a feed URL

## Installing
```sh
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/johlar/poddy.git

# 2. Install, build and package the application
cd poddy && npm install && npm package

# 3. Make it available in your shell 
npm link

# 4. Verify that it works! 
poddy --version
```

When running Poddy for the first time, a configuration file and subscriptions file will be generated for you. See [Configuration](#subscriptions).

## Usage Examples

Show all available commands
```
poddy --help
```

Find a feed to download from
```
poddy search --name "Self-Hosted"
```

Download all episodes from a feed
```
poddy download --url "https://example.com/rss"
```

Download 5 latest episodes from a feed
```
poddy download --url "https://example.com/rss" --episodes -5
```

Download the earliest 2 episodes from a feed
```
poddy download --url "https://example.com/rss" --episodes 2
```

Download a range of episodes from a feed
```
poddy download --url "https://example.com/rss" --episodes 10-15
```

Subscribe to two feeds and continously download episodes. However using [subscriptions.json](#subscriptionsjson) is recommended for convenience and versatility.
```
poddy subscribe --urls "https://example1.com/rss" "https://example2.com/rss"
```

## Configuration

Poddy uses two configuration files: `config.json` and `subscriptions.json`. By default they will be in `~/.config/poddy/`. This location can be overridden with the environment variables _PODDY_CONFIG_FILE_ and _PODDY_SUBSCRIPTIONS_FILE_.

### Search Engine Configuration

iTunes is the default search engine and requires no additional configuration. If you instead wish to use PodcastIndex.org you will need API credentials which are quick and easy to set up on [podcastindex.org](https://api.podcastindex.org/signup). Add the *API Key* and *API Secret* to your configuration file and change the searchEngine parameter from *iTunes* to *PodcastIndex* to make it the new default.

### config.json
The properties in config.json will be used if no corresponding CLI arguments are passed.

Example:
```json
{
  "downloadDirectory": "/Users/me/Podcasts",
  "includeShownotes": true,
  "searchEngine": "iTunes",
  "searchEngineOptions": {
        "PodcastIndex": {
            "apiKey": "",
            "apiSecret": ""
        }
    }
}
```

### subscriptions.json

You can use subscriptions.json to configure your podcast subscriptions, and then simply run `poddy subscribe` in your terminal.

For each subscription object:

`url` property is **required** and should be the podcast feed URL. To find a feed URL, you can use `poddy search --name "the podcast name"`.

`interval` is optional and decides the number of seconds beteween each feed refresh. Default: 600.

`includeShownotes` is optional and decides whether to download the shownotes. If not set, the value must be set in config.json or passed as a CLI argument. 

Example: 
```json
{
    "subscriptions": [
        {
            "url": "https://example1.com/rss",
        },
        {
            "url": "https://example2.com/rss",
            "interval": 7200,
            "includeShownotes": false
        }
    ]
}
```
## Uninstalling

Removing Poddy is super simple. Just delete the downloaded repository and then remove the symlink by running: `npm r poddy -g`

## Development

When passing arguments in local development, don't forget the separator (e.g. `npm run start -- search --name "some podcast"`). Local gitignored configuration files for development will be generated in the base directory on the first run.
