# Poddy - CLI Podcast Downloader

**NOTE! Poddy is still in BETA. Semantic versioning is not enforced and non-backwards compatible changes may be released at any time.** 

This command line tool downloads podcast episodes from an RSS feed.

I originally made Poddy for my own use to help me archive my favorite podcasts. I'm hoping it might be useful for other data hoarders out there! ðŸ“¦ðŸ“š

Let me know if you encounter any issues and feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.

## Uninstalling

Removing Poddy is super simple. Just delete the downloaded repository and then remove the symlink by running: `npm r poddy -g`

## Development

When passing arguments in local development, don't forget the separator (e.g. `npm run start -- search --name "some podcast"`).
