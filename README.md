# Poddy - The CLI Podcast Downloader

This command line tool downloads podcast episodes from an RSS feed.

I originally made Poddy for my own use to help me archive my favorite podcasts. I'm hoping it might be useful for other data hoarders out there! ðŸ“¦ðŸ“š

Let me know if you encounter any issues and feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.
